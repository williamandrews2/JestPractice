📝 # JestPractice

This is a repository dedicated to learning and practicing **Jest** as part of [this lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-testing-practice) in The Odin Project. I am currently learning how to write unit tests, and in this repository, you can see the small examples and exercises I perform to learn about Jest's features and best practices.
